# tf-bilinear-cnn

### Requirements

1. TensorFlow with gpu support, my TensorFlow version is 1.80

2. You shold have at least one dataset to run the training procedure [FGVC-Aircraft](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/fgvc-aircraft/),  [Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011](http://www.vision.caltech.edu/visipedia/CUB-200-2011.html), [Cars Dataset
](https://ai.stanford.edu/~jkrause/cars/car_dataset.html)

### Training & Testing

## My Results

| Dataset         | CUB200           | FGVC-Aircraft        | Standford Cars       | 
|-----------------|------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| Accuracy        | -----%           | -----%               | -----%               |
